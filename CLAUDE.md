# CLAUDE.md — grok-build-vscode

VS Code sidebar extension for **xAI's Grok Build CLI**, driven by `grok agent stdio` over the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com). Thin client — all session state, MCP servers, subagents, memory, and plan-mode bookkeeping live in the CLI.

## Status

v1.4.6 (releasing now; v1.4.5 is the latest GitHub Release — the Marketplace-published build lags behind). 437 tests passing, all grok-free (CI never spawns the binary; grok-dependent probes live separately in `research/*.cjs`). The **v1.4.x** line added **image + video generation** rendered inline (`/imagine` → `image_gen`, or `image_edit` for reference-photo edits; `/imagine-video` → `video_gen`, older/Linux builds `image_to_video`; grok writes the file to the session dir and reports its path as JSON-in-text on the completed tool result — *not* an ACP image block — so the host parses the path, classifies image-vs-video by extension, and serves it to the webview via `webview.asWebviewUri` — streamed from disk; a base64 `data:` URI is only a fallback for files outside the grok home. Inline media is capped at 320px with Copy-path / Open-in-VS-Code hover actions pinned to the image; see `research/image-generation.md`), and a **Sign out** action (`grok logout`, command + gear menu, issue #13). A **subagent card** classifier (`isSubagentToolCall`/`subagentLabel` in `webview-helpers.js`) exists but is **research-only / deferred** — grok 0.2.x doesn't emit `spawn_subagent` over ACP (it backgrounds a process and polls `get_command_or_subagent_output`), so the card rarely fires and isn't advertised as a shipped feature; see `research/subagents.md`. v1.4.3 also **defers the plan-mode primer** — it's no longer sent at session start; it rides the user's first real prompt as its own hidden turn, on new AND restored sessions (re-sent on restore rather than trusted from replayed history, which a `/compact` can drop). v1.4.4 fixes **auto-scroll fighting the user** (#16): the chat used to snap to the bottom on every streaming chunk, so scrolling up to re-read history while grok was thinking was undone on the next thought chunk. Now a `stickToBottom` flag (driven by a scroll listener via the pure `shouldStickToBottom` in `webview-helpers.js`) follows streaming output only while the user is already pinned to the bottom; interactive activity that must be seen — permission cards, ask-user-question cards, and the user's own sent message — re-pins via `forceScrollToBottom()` (also addresses #15). Wire shapes were confirmed against `grok` 0.2.33 (Linux probes); the native Windows build is `grok` 0.2.x. Smoke-tested end-to-end against `grok` v0.1.211 on Linux and Windows-via-WSL, and against the **native Windows build** `grok` 0.2.3 (`irm https://x.ai/cli/install.ps1 | iex`) — `cli-locator` resolves `grok.cmd`/`grok.exe` and `terminal-manager` uses `shell:true`. The native-Windows smoke test surfaced a handful of webview regressions (history popover that never closed, session rows only clickable on the label, reasoning traces no longer expandable, a cluttered welcome screen), all fixed in earlier builds. Plan mode is **enabled** and enforced client-side (see `research/plan-mode.md` § Resolution). **Voice input** (v1.3.0) adds a composer mic button that records via an `ffmpeg` child process in the extension host and transcribes through xAI's *separate* Speech-to-Text API — deliberately outside ACP, because the CLI advertises `promptCapabilities.audio:false` and webviews can't reach the mic (see `research/voice-input.md`). Transcription is **live/streaming by default** (PCM → `wss://api.x.ai/v1/stt`, partial events accumulated by `start`; `grok.voiceStreaming:false` falls back to the batch REST endpoint). Listening is **continuous + hands-free**: saying **"grok send"** submits and restarts a fresh stream so the mic keeps listening (each message = one clean utterance), and messages dictated while Grok is responding are queued and flushed on `agentEnd`. The phrase is sent as a `keyterm` bias so STT spells it right, and the trailing phrase is highlighted in the composer via a backdrop overlay (pure `trailingSendPhrase` in `webview-helpers.js`). This adds the extension's first runtime dep, `ws` (bundled into the vsix — `package`/`publish` no longer pass `--no-dependencies`, and `.vscodeignore` un-ignores `node_modules/ws`). v1.4.5 adds **LaTeX / math rendering**: grok now answers with TeX (inline `\(…\)`, display `\[…\]`, incl. `\begin{pmatrix}` matrices), which the hand-rolled `renderMarkdown` previously showed raw. The pure `splitMath` (in `webview-helpers.js`) pulls math out *before* HTML-escaping (so backslashes/braces survive the inline-markdown pass) into `\x00D`/`\x00M` placeholders — mirroring the code-block/table extraction; `renderMath` in `chat.js` renders each span via vendored **[KaTeX](https://katex.org)** (`media/katex/`, woff2-only fonts, ~600 KB, no network) with `throwOnError:false` (malformed → inline red error, never blanks the message) and a raw-TeX fallback when KaTeX isn't loaded (e.g. happy-dom unit tests). Display math is its own block with horizontal scroll; CSP gains `font-src ${webview.cspSource}` for the KaTeX fonts. Single `$…$` is deliberately **not** a delimiter (prose-currency false positives). The pure `stripUnsupportedTex` (in `webview-helpers.js`) drops `\label{…}` before rendering — grok emits it inside `align`/`equation` blocks for cross-referencing, but KaTeX has no `\ref`/`\eqref` system so it paints the label as a red error; `\label` produces no visible output in real LaTeX anyway, so stripping it loses nothing. v1.4.6 adds **Mermaid diagram rendering**: grok answers with ` ```mermaid ` fenced blocks (flowcharts, sequence/state diagrams, git graphs, class diagrams, …), which `renderMarkdown` previously showed as raw source. The fenced block now becomes a `.mermaid-block` placeholder carrying the source as a fallback code block; a post-render pass `renderMermaidIn` (in `chat.js`) renders it to SVG via vendored **[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org)** (`media/mermaid/mermaid.min.js`, the self-contained 3.3 MB IIFE that sets `globalThis.mermaid` — all diagram types inlined, zero dynamic `import()`, no `eval`/`new Function` so the nonce CSP needs no `unsafe-eval`). Unlike KaTeX's synchronous string render, `mermaid.render` is **async and DOM-based** (it measures text to lay out nodes), so it can't run inline in `renderMarkdown` — it post-processes the inserted element. The streaming agent bubble re-runs `renderMarkdown` (rebuilding the DOM) every animation frame, so two module-level caches keyed by the diagram source keep that cheap + flicker-free: `mermaidSvgCache` (src → svg) re-applies the SVG synchronously on a cache hit (same frame, no flash), and `mermaidInFlight` (src) stops the same diagram being laid out dozens of times before the first async render resolves; a failed/ malformed render caches `null` and leaves the readable source. `initMermaid` themes it to VS Code dark/light (`document.body.classList`), `securityLevel:"strict"` + `suppressErrorRendering:true`. A half-streamed block stays raw text until its closing ` ``` ` arrives (the code-block regex requires it). No CSP change needed (mermaid's inline `<style>`/`style=` are covered by the existing `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`). **Limitation:** a live theme switch doesn't re-theme already-rendered diagrams (cache holds the old-theme SVG) until the webview reloads.

| `src/acp-dispatch.ts` | Pure protocol helpers — line parsing, update routing, response builders, generated-media extraction (`isMediaGenToolCall`/`extractGeneratedMediaPaths`) |
| `src/cli-locator.ts` | Locate `grok` binary (configured path → `~/.grok/bin/grok` → PATH); cross-platform |

Pure modules (`acp-dispatch`, `chips`, `prompt-builder`, `slash-filter`, `cli-locator`, `sessions`, `plan-gate`, `plan-restore`, `grok-primer`, `file-ref`, `plan-review`, `voice`, `webview-helpers`) were split out specifically so protocol behavior can be unit-tested without spawning processes. The impure `voice-recorder`/`voice-streamer` (ffmpeg spawn + STT fetch/WebSocket) are smoke-tested manually via the `research/voice-*.cjs` probes (`voice-stt-probe`, `voice-e2e-verify`, `voice-stream-probe`, `voice-stream-verify`, `voice-cost-probe`).

## Build + test

```bash
npm install
npm test         # 437 tests, ~1.5s, vitest — all grok-free (incl. happy-dom DOM tests + fake-CLI ACP integration tests)
npm run package  # → grok-vscode-phuryn-1.4.6.vsix (clears older *.vsix first)
```

### Test taxonomy — three layers

There are **three** kinds of tests, and it matters which is which:

1. **`npm test` — grok-free unit/DOM/integration suite (437 tests).** Pure logic, happy-dom tests that drive the real `media/chat.js`, a real-`/bin/sh` TerminalManager smoke, and a fake-CLI ACP integration suite (`test/fixtures/fake-grok-acp.cjs`). **Never spawns the real `grok` binary.** Runs in <2s with no network, no login, no subscription. This is the floor — every change keeps it green.
2. **CI — the *same* suite.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm ci && npm test && npm run package` on a clean Ubuntu box. **CI ≡ layer 1, verbatim** — there is no separate CI-only set. CI has no `grok` binary, no auth, no SuperGrok subscription, so it *cannot* run anything that touches the real CLI. That's the whole reason layer 1 is grok-free.
3. **`npm run test:live` — on-demand pre-release suite against REAL grok (`scripts/live-tests.cjs`).** Spawns the actual `grok agent stdio` and exercises the surfaces layers 1–2 can't: the real ACP handshake, a prompt round-trip, session restore, plan-mode enforcement, and the v1.4.x generative features (image gen, video gen; the subagent path is exercised opportunistically and SKIPs when grok doesn't delegate — it's deferred/research-only). It **reuses the real compiled modules** (`out/acp-dispatch.js`, `out/plan-gate.js`, `media/webview-helpers.js`) — it feeds genuine wire output through the same `isMediaGenToolCall`/`extractGeneratedMediaPaths`/`isSubagentToolCall`/`shouldBlockWrite` the extension uses, not a re-implementation. **Always run it before every release-to-`main` — it's a non-negotiable, standing part of the release gate; run it without asking** (it needs a logged-in grok + subscription and burns credits, so it must never be in `npm test` or CI, but it is mandatory before any tag/release). Flags: `--quick` (skip the slow generative tests), `--only=`, `--skip=`, `GROK_BIN=…`. A SKIP (no subscription, grok chose not to delegate, etc.) does not fail the gate — only a FAIL does. Real-grok **diagnostic probes** (`research/*.cjs`) remain manual one-offs for capturing wire shapes; the live suite is the repeatable gate.

**So:** local == CI (both grok-free). The real-grok tests are a separate, mandatory pre-release gate — always run before a tag/release (no need to ask), never on every commit.

### grok CLI version + updating

The native-Windows build (`irm https://x.ai/cli/install.ps1 | iex`) is **`grok` 0.2.3** on the **stable** channel; the Linux probes in the docs were against 0.2.33 (a different release line — note the gap when reconciling wire shapes). **grok does not auto-update.** Updating is the explicit `grok update` command: `grok update --check [--json]` checks without installing, `grok update` installs the latest on the current channel, `--stable` (default, weekly) / `--alpha` switch channels, `--version <X.Y.Z>` pins a specific build. Re-run `npm run test:live` after any CLI update — the wire format is the thing that drifts.

## Install

- **macOS / Linux / WSL Ubuntu:** `./scripts/install.sh`
- **Windows (native):** `pwsh scripts\install.ps1` — runs the native Windows `grok` CLI directly
- **WSL Ubuntu (alternative):** Remote-WSL → install in the WSL-side VS Code server

See `README.md § Install` for the full per-platform matrix.

## ACP surfaces implemented

- `initialize` → `session/new` / `session/load` → `session/set_model` → `session/prompt` lifecycle
- **Model switching is agent-aware.** Models belong to *agent types* — `grok-build`/`grok-build-plan` vs the `cursor` agent that owns the Composer models. The CLI binds the agent at spawn and locks it after the first turn (incl. our primer), so a live `session/set_model` only works within the same agent; a cross-agent switch errors `MODEL_SWITCH_INCOMPATIBLE_AGENT` ("Start a new session"). `switchModel` in `sidebar.ts` tries the live switch, and on that error (detected by the pure `isIncompatibleAgentError` in `acp-dispatch.ts`) persists the pick to `grok.defaultModel` and restarts — `newSession` re-applies the model *before* the primer runs, while the agent is still rebindable. No history → transparent restart; with history → the same Summarize/Just-Restart prompt as an effort change (shared `pickRestartMode`/`restartSession` helpers). The toolbar model label resolves IDs to user-facing names via the pure `modelDisplayName` helper.
- Streaming `agent_message_chunk` + `agent_thought_chunk`
- Sessions: list/resume via `session/load` (grok stores them at `~/.grok/sessions/<urlencoded-cwd>/<id>/`); rename/delete metadata in `context.globalState["grok.sessionMeta"]`. We never edit grok's own session files.
- Handlers (mandatory or the agent crashes): `fs/read_text_file`, `fs/write_text_file`, `terminal/{create,output,wait_for_exit,kill,release}`
- `session/request_permission` → chat card with `allow-always` / `allow-once` / `reject-once`, diff editor preview for `kind:"edit"`
- `x.ai/ask_user_question` → inline question card (the tool was fully broken before — #12). The catch-all ACK'd unknown server requests with `{}`, which grok's deserializer rejects with "missing field `outcome`". Now handled: the card renders each question's options (single question + single-select resolves on one click; otherwise pick-then-Submit; Skip → cancel) and replies `{ outcome: "accepted", answers, annotations }` (or `cancelled`). `answers` is keyed by question text → chosen label. On answer the card collapses to the question + a green `✓ <choice>` (so it's clear grok received it). On session resume the question replays as a `tool_call` (questions in `rawInput`) + completed `tool_call_update` (answer text); chat.js suppresses the generic tool chip for `ask_user_question` and rebuilds a read-only "You answered" card from that replay — no separate persistence. The full binary-derived wire format is in `research/ask-user-question.md`. Response builders are pure (`makeQuestionResponse` in `acp-dispatch.ts`); the answer map is built by the pure `buildQuestionAnswers` in `webview-helpers.js`.
- `session/set_mode` wired; the picker exposes **Agent**, **Plan**, and **YOLO**. The CLI's non-plan mode id is `"default"` (not `"agent"`), captured as `ACT_MODE_ID` in `sidebar.ts`.
- **Plan mode is enforced client-side** (mirror of YOLO). The CLI's `x.ai/exit_plan_mode` still treats any client response — result *or* error — as approval (re-verified broken in 0.2.3), so we don't rely on it. Instead `src/plan-gate.ts` gates the two *mandatory* server→client choke points: `fs/write_text_file` (block writes resolving inside the workspace cwd) and `terminal/create` (block anything not on the read-only allowlist). grok's own `~/.grok/sessions/<…>/plan.md` write lands *outside* the workspace and is allowed (and snooped to recover the plan text — `exit_plan_mode` arrives with `planContent: null`). Approve → drop the gate + send an "implement it now" follow-up prompt; Keep planning → gate stays up. Entering plan mode *any* way (incl. agent-initiated `current_mode_update: plan`) raises the gate; it's lowered only by explicit user action, never auto-lowered by CLI mode flapping. The verdict protocol is taught by a hidden **primer** (`src/grok-primer.ts`) — it tells grok to ignore the bogus `exit_plan_mode` result and read `[Plan approved]`/`[Plan rejected]`/`[Plan cancelled]` (optionally + a comment) from the follow-up message. **The primer is sent lazily** as its own hidden turn right before the user's first real prompt — on new AND restored sessions — not at session start (`ensurePrimed` in `sidebar.ts`); on restore it's *re-sent* on first send rather than trusted from replayed history (a `/compact` can drop it). The pure `isPrimerText()` detects the primer when grok replays it so the bubble is hidden + not counted toward plan positions. For the full pedagogical course with diagrams and hands-on guidance, see `research/understanding-plan-mode.md`.
- `grok.defaultEffort` → forwarded as `--reasoning-effort <value>` **before** the `stdio` subcommand (it's an agent-level flag; after `stdio` the CLI errors "unexpected argument"). Offered values mirror grok's accepted set (`none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh`); the bogus `max` we used to expose made grok exit code 2 (#3/#4). Args are built by the pure `buildGrokAgentArgs()`; changing effort restarts the session (`setEffort` in `sidebar.ts`).
- `available_commands_update` → slash autocomplete
- `current_mode_update` → bottom-toolbar mode button (the top bar was removed in 0.9.0)
- `_meta.totalTokens` → context donut
- **Generated media (v1.4.x).** `/imagine` (`image_gen`, or `image_edit` for reference-photo edits) and `/imagine-video` (`video_gen`; older/Linux builds `image_to_video`) are subscription-only and do **not** return ACP image blocks — grok writes the file into its session dir (`images/*.jpg`, `videos/*.mp4`) and reports the path as a JSON string in the completed tool result's `text` content. The pure `isMediaGenToolCall`/`extractGeneratedMediaPaths` (in `acp-dispatch.ts`) detect the tool and parse the path (image-vs-video by extension); `acp.ts` tracks the tool-call id (the *completed* update has a null title) and emits `mediaContent`; `sidebar.ts` `postGeneratedMedia` serves the file via `webview.asWebviewUri` (streamed from disk under the grok-home `localResourceRoot` — what made multi-MB `/imagine-video` clips render; a base64 `data:` URI is only the fallback for files outside the served roots). CSP grants `img-src`/`media-src ${webview.cspSource} data:`. Inline media is capped at 320px with Copy-path / Open-in-VS-Code hover actions pinned to the image. On resume grok replays it as a single collapsed `tool_call` carrying title + path together, so the same path fires. Wire format + probes in `research/image-generation.md` (`research/imagine-probe.cjs`, `research/video-probe.cjs`).
- **Subagent card (deferred / research-only).** A pure classifier (`isSubagentToolCall`/`subagentLabel` in `webview-helpers.js`) *would* give a delegation a distinct *Subagent: \<type\>* card, but grok 0.2.x does **not** expose subagents as a `spawn_subagent` ACP tool — it backgrounds a process and polls it via `get_command_or_subagent_output` (which the classifier explicitly excludes), so the card rarely fires. Not advertised as a shipped feature (dropped from the README in 1.4.3); see `research/subagents.md`.
- **Logout (v1.4.0, #13).** `grok.logout` command + gear-menu *Sign out* → `sidebar.logout()` runs `grok logout`, disposes the session, shows the auth-required onboarding.

## Known limits

- Subagent delegation cards are deferred — grok 0.2.x doesn't emit `spawn_subagent` over ACP (it backgrounds a process + polls), so the classifier rarely fires; even when it does, child tool calls aren't nested (no inspector)
- Generated media is served via `asWebviewUri` (streamed from disk) when it lives under the grok-home `localResourceRoot`; files outside that fall back to a base64 `data:` URI
- No worktree UI
- Diff editor is preview-only; the write happens via `fs/write_text_file` after approval
- View defaults to left activity bar; user must drag to secondary side bar manually if desired

## Cross-platform notes

- `terminal-manager.ts` uses `spawn(cmd, { shell: true })` so Node picks `cmd.exe` on Windows, `/bin/sh` elsewhere. Don't hardcode shell paths.
- `cli-locator.ts` reads `HOME` / `USERPROFILE` env vars first (testability), falls back to `os.homedir()`. Uses `where` on Windows, `command -v` elsewhere. Checks `.cmd`/`.exe`/`.bat` extensions on Windows.
- Tests use `node -e "..."` everywhere, so commands are deterministic across platforms — don't add `pwd`, `awk`, `sleep`, `true`, etc.

## What's next (priority order)

1. `@vscode/test-electron` integration suite (scoped in `TESTS.md § v0.2`)
2. Status-bar indicator (current model + effort + token usage)
3. Subagent support — grok 0.2.x doesn't expose `spawn_subagent` over ACP, so the existing classifier is dormant; revisit if/when the CLI surfaces delegations as a tool call (then add the nested inspector that groups child calls under the card)
4. Worktree UI (`Grok: New Worktree Session`)
5. Optional: auto-move view to secondary side bar on first activation (`workbench.action.moveView`)

## Publishing

**Release procedure — ALWAYS tag + create a GitHub Release (with the `.vsix` attached) on a release push to `main`** (standing convention; mirrors the `v1.0.0…` tag history + GitHub Releases):

**The whole procedure below (steps 2–5) is scripted** — after bumping the version + writing the changelog section (step 1, user-initiated), just run:

```bash
pwsh scripts\release.ps1        # Windows (native) — what we use here
./scripts/release.sh            # macOS / Linux / WSL
```

It reads the version from `package.json`, runs the gate, builds the vsix, commits the working tree (`-MessageFile`/`-Message` override the default `Release vX.Y.Z`), pushes `main`, creates the annotated tag, and runs `gh release create` **with the vsix attached** — extracting the matching `## X.Y.Z` changelog section as the release notes. `-DryRun`/`--dry-run` previews; `-NoTest`/`--no-test` skips the gate. It refuses to run off `main` or when the tag already exists (i.e. the version wasn't bumped). It does **not** publish to the Marketplace.

What the script encodes, step by step:

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` (user-initiated) and add the dated section to `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. `npm test` (437-test floor, all green) + `tsc -p . --noEmit` clean, **and `npm run test:live` against real grok — mandatory, run without asking** (the `release.*` scripts don't run it, so run it by hand before invoking them).
3. Commit + push to `main` (direct-to-main, no feature branches).
4. **Annotated git tag** `vX.Y.Z` at the release commit → `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"` → `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
5. **GitHub Release** for that tag → `gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "Release vX.Y.Z" --notes-file <notes> <vsix>` (notes = the new changelog section(s); include any earlier version that was bumped but never released). **Always attach the built `grok-vscode-phuryn-X.Y.Z.vsix` as a release asset** so the exact installable build is downloadable from the release.
6. **Marketplace publish is separate and explicit** — only `npm run publish` (vsce) when the user asks. The `PawelHuryn` publisher is registered + authenticated locally; publishing ≠ tagging.

Don't skip the tag/release (or the vsix asset) on a release push. (A pure mid-dev version bump that isn't a release — e.g. the unreleased v1.3.0 voice iteration — is the only exception.)

## Repo conventions

- Direct-to-`main`, no feature branches
- Commits explain the *why*, not the *what*
- Don't introduce abstractions speculatively
- Don't add comments that explain what well-named code already says
- 437 tests is the floor — every PR should keep that green. All tests are grok-free (no binary spawn); grok-dependent probes live in `research/*.cjs` and are run manually, never by `npm test` or CI
- **Rebuilding clears older `.vsix` first** — `npm run package` (and the install/release scripts) delete stale `grok-vscode-phuryn-*.vsix` before building, so only the current version is on disk. After any doc or code change, rebuild + reinstall so the installed extension's bundled docs are current.
- **Version bumps are user-initiated.** Iterate at the current version (rebuild the same vsix and reinstall locally) until the user says to bump and publish. Don't bump `package.json` on your own.
- **Sign GitHub comments.** Every GitHub issue/PR comment posted on the user's behalf ends with a final line: `_Written by Pawel's agent_` (italic, on its own line).
