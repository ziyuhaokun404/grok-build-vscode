# CLAUDE.md — grok-build-vscode

VS Code sidebar extension for **xAI's Grok Build CLI**, driven by `grok agent stdio` over the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com). Thin client — all session state, MCP servers, subagents, memory, and plan-mode bookkeeping live in the CLI.

## Status

v1.2.0 (local; 1.0.3 is the latest published on the VS Code Marketplace). 178 tests passing, all grok-free (CI never spawns the binary; grok-dependent probes live separately in `research/*.cjs`). Smoke-tested end-to-end against `grok` v0.1.211 on Linux and Windows-via-WSL, and against the **native Windows build** `grok` 0.2.3 (`irm https://x.ai/cli/install.ps1 | iex`) — `cli-locator` resolves `grok.cmd`/`grok.exe` and `terminal-manager` uses `shell:true`. The native-Windows smoke test surfaced a handful of webview regressions (history popover that never closed, session rows only clickable on the label, reasoning traces no longer expandable, a cluttered welcome screen), all fixed in this build. Plan mode is now **enabled** and enforced client-side (see `research/plan-mode.md` § Resolution).

## Module map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/extension.ts` | Entry point — registers commands, keybindings, output channel |
| `src/sidebar.ts` | Webview provider, message routing, fs handlers, diff editor preview |
| `src/acp.ts` | ACP client — spawns CLI, manages session lifecycle, emits events |
| `src/acp-dispatch.ts` | Pure protocol helpers — line parsing, update routing, response builders |
| `src/cli-locator.ts` | Locate `grok` binary (configured path → `~/.grok/bin/grok` → PATH); cross-platform |
| `src/terminal-manager.ts` | Headless shell children for the agent's `terminal/*` ACP calls; cross-platform via `shell:true` |
| `src/chips.ts` | File-chip CRUD (pure) |
| `src/prompt-builder.ts` | Chip → prompt-string with `@path` refs and fenced code blocks |
| `src/slash-filter.ts` | Slash-command autocomplete filter |
| `src/plan-gate.ts` | Plan-mode policy (pure) — workspace-write containment, read-only command allowlist, permission/plan-file classification |
| `src/plan-restore.ts` | Plan persist + restore decision (pure) — appendPlanEntry + decideRestoreState |
| `src/sessions.ts` | Disk-driven session listing/delete + customName overrides (pure) |
| `media/chat.{js,css}` | Webview UI |
| `media/webview-helpers.js` | Pure webview helpers (file-ref detection, relative-time format); shared between webview and tests |
| `scripts/install.{ps1,sh}` | Auto-detect VS Code CLI, build .vsix, install |
| `scripts/uninstall.{ps1,sh}` | Uninstall `PawelHuryn.grok-vscode-phuryn` |

Pure modules (`acp-dispatch`, `chips`, `prompt-builder`, `slash-filter`, `cli-locator`, `sessions`, `plan-gate`, `plan-restore`, `webview-helpers`) were split out specifically so protocol behavior can be unit-tested without spawning processes.

## Build + test

```bash
npm install
npm test         # 178 tests, ~1.4s, vitest — all grok-free (incl. happy-dom DOM tests + fake-CLI ACP integration tests)
npm run package  # → grok-vscode-phuryn-1.2.0.vsix
```

## Install

- **macOS / Linux / WSL Ubuntu:** `./scripts/install.sh`
- **Windows (native):** `pwsh scripts\install.ps1` — runs the native Windows `grok` CLI directly
- **WSL Ubuntu (alternative):** Remote-WSL → install in the WSL-side VS Code server

See `README.md § Install` for the full per-platform matrix.

## ACP surfaces implemented

- `initialize` → `session/new` / `session/load` → `session/set_model` → `session/prompt` lifecycle
- Streaming `agent_message_chunk` + `agent_thought_chunk`
- Sessions: list/resume via `session/load` (grok stores them at `~/.grok/sessions/<urlencoded-cwd>/<id>/`); rename/delete metadata in `context.globalState["grok.sessionMeta"]`. We never edit grok's own session files.
- Handlers (mandatory or the agent crashes): `fs/read_text_file`, `fs/write_text_file`, `terminal/{create,output,wait_for_exit,kill,release}`
- `session/request_permission` → chat card with `allow-always` / `allow-once` / `reject-once`, diff editor preview for `kind:"edit"`
- `session/set_mode` wired; the picker exposes **Agent**, **Plan**, and **YOLO**. The CLI's non-plan mode id is `"default"` (not `"agent"`), captured as `ACT_MODE_ID` in `sidebar.ts`.
- **Plan mode is enforced client-side** (mirror of YOLO). The CLI's `x.ai/exit_plan_mode` still treats any client response — result *or* error — as approval (re-verified broken in 0.2.3), so we don't rely on it. Instead `src/plan-gate.ts` gates the two *mandatory* server→client choke points: `fs/write_text_file` (block writes resolving inside the workspace cwd) and `terminal/create` (block anything not on the read-only allowlist). grok's own `~/.grok/sessions/<…>/plan.md` write lands *outside* the workspace and is allowed (and snooped to recover the plan text — `exit_plan_mode` arrives with `planContent: null`). Approve → drop the gate + send an "implement it now" follow-up prompt; Keep planning → gate stays up. Entering plan mode *any* way (incl. agent-initiated `current_mode_update: plan`) raises the gate; it's lowered only by explicit user action, never auto-lowered by CLI mode flapping. For the full pedagogical course with diagrams and hands-on guidance, see `research/understanding-plan-mode.md`.
- `--reasoning-effort` flag at agent spawn (`low | medium | high | xhigh | max`)
- `available_commands_update` → slash autocomplete
- `current_mode_update` → bottom-toolbar mode button (the top bar was removed in 0.9.0)
- `_meta.totalTokens` → context donut

## Known limits

- Subagent messages render inline as tool cards — no dedicated inspector
- No worktree UI
- Diff editor is preview-only; the write happens via `fs/write_text_file` after approval
- View defaults to left activity bar; user must drag to secondary side bar manually if desired

## Cross-platform notes

- `terminal-manager.ts` uses `spawn(cmd, { shell: true })` so Node picks `cmd.exe` on Windows, `/bin/sh` elsewhere. Don't hardcode shell paths.
- `cli-locator.ts` reads `HOME` / `USERPROFILE` env vars first (testability), falls back to `os.homedir()`. Uses `where` on Windows, `command -v` elsewhere. Checks `.cmd`/`.exe`/`.bat` extensions on Windows.
- Tests use `node -e "..."` everywhere, so commands are deterministic across platforms — don't add `pwd`, `awk`, `sleep`, `true`, etc.

## What's next (priority order)

1. `@vscode/test-electron` integration suite (scoped in `TESTS.md § v0.2`)
2. Status-bar indicator (current model + effort + token usage)
3. Subagent inspector (collapsible side panel)
4. Worktree UI (`Grok: New Worktree Session`)
5. Optional: auto-move view to secondary side bar on first activation (`workbench.action.moveView`)

## Publishing

Per-release: bump version in `package.json`, `npm test`, `npm run publish`. The `PawelHuryn` publisher is already registered and authenticated locally.

## Repo conventions

- Direct-to-`main`, no feature branches
- Commits explain the *why*, not the *what*
- Don't introduce abstractions speculatively
- Don't add comments that explain what well-named code already says
- 178 tests is the floor — every PR should keep that green. All tests are grok-free (no binary spawn); grok-dependent probes live in `research/*.cjs` and are run manually, never by `npm test` or CI
- **Version bumps are user-initiated.** Iterate at the current version (rebuild the same vsix and reinstall locally) until the user says to bump and publish. Don't bump `package.json` on your own.
