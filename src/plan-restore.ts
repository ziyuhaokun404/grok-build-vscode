// Pure helpers for the plan-mode persist + restore state machine. Split from
// sidebar.ts so the verdict log and the on-resume decision can be unit-tested
// without mocking vscode, the ACP client, or the filesystem.
//
// Background:
//  - The CLI's `x.ai/exit_plan_mode` treats any response as approval (see
//    research/plan-mode.md). The extension persists each resolved plan locally
//    so the live verdict and the resume view both reflect what the user
//    actually chose, not what the CLI thinks happened.
//  - Plan content + verdict + `afterUserMessage` (count of user messages sent
//    at the moment the plan was resolved) are appended via `appendPlanEntry`.
//  - On resume, `decideRestoreState` returns the plan-gate + CLI-mode the host
//    should restore to, based on the *last* verdict. "rejected" means the user
//    was still planning, so the gate goes back up. Everything else (including
//    no saved plans) leaves the gate down — safer than wrongly restoring plan
//    mode on a session the user already cancelled or approved.
