// text) — see `parseAttachmentContext` in media/webview-helpers.js. The inner

// is just an unambiguous envelope. The `note` tells grok it's editor-injected.

/**
 * Build the final prompt text from a typed message + active chips.
 *
 * - Hidden chips are skipped.
 * - A chip with a selection range becomes a fenced code block of those lines.
 * - A chip without a range becomes a bare path — NOT an `@`-reference. `@` is grok's
 *   "read this whole file" convention, which slurps a large file into context (a big
 *   CSV/log) and fails outright on binaries (an image/video → *"Cannot read binary
 *   file"*; grok has no vision). Handing grok the plain path lets it choose how to
 *   consume each: grep/range-read big text, pass an image/video path to its media
 *   tools, read a small file in full. No per-type classification — grok infers from
 *   the extension.
 * - Whole-file chips are split by origin: a file the user explicitly attached is the
 *   strong "act on this" signal ("Attached file(s)"), while the active-editor file
 *   auto-included for ambient context is the weaker "this is what I'm looking at"
 *   signal ("Currently open in the editor (for context)"). Keeping them apart stops
 *   grok treating a file you happen to have open as one you asked it to work on.
 * - The user's text follows after a blank line.
