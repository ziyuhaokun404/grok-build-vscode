/**
 * Build the final prompt text from a typed message + active chips.
 *
 * - Hidden chips are skipped.
 * - A chip with a selection range becomes a fenced code block of those lines.
 * - A chip without a range becomes a bare path — NOT an `@`-reference. `@` is grok's
 *   "read this whole file" convention, which slurps a large file into context (a big
 *   CSV/log) and fails outright on binaries. Handing grok the plain path lets it
 *   choose how to consume each: grep/range-read big text, pass a video path to its
 *   media tools, read a small file in full. Raster images (png/jpg/gif/webp) are
 *   split off UPSTREAM (addDroppedFile → makeImageChip) and ride the inline-vision
 *   blocks in buildPromptWithImages instead — what reaches this path list is text,
 *   SVG (kept editable on purpose), videos, and oversized images.
 * - Whole-file chips are split by origin: a file the user explicitly attached is the
 *   strong "act on this" signal ("Attached file(s)"), while the active-editor file
 *   auto-included for ambient context is the weaker "this is what I'm looking at"
 *   signal ("Currently open in the editor (for context)"). Keeping them apart stops
 *   grok treating a file you happen to have open as one you asked it to work on.
 * - The user's text follows after a blank line — EXCEPT for confirmed slash
 *   commands (`slashCommand: true`), where the order flips and the context
 *   trails the text instead. The CLI dispatches a slash command only when it
 *   sits at position 0 of the text block; a leading envelope silently degrades
 *   `/compact` into an ordinary LLM turn that ballooned context 6x in testing
 *   (research/compact-probe.cjs, grok 0.2.87 — trailing context verified to
 *   keep native dispatch). Restore still strips a trailing envelope
 *   (parseAttachmentContext matches anywhere), but selection snippets are only
 *   peeled from the body's start, so a slash+selection send replays its
 *   snippet inline — acceptable for that rare combination.

/**

 * attached image (base64 inline — verified accepted by grok 0.2.87 despite the
 * advertised `promptCapabilities.image:false`; see research/vision-input.md).
 *
 * Shape invariants:
 * - No images → the text is byte-identical to `buildPrompt(text, chips)`, so
 *   the restore parser (`parseAttachmentContext`) sees the exact legacy wire.
 * - With images → `<envelope>\n\n<text>\n\n<tags>`: the user's text stays at
 *   the start of its own section (a leading tag would knock a `/command` off
 *   position 0 and break CLI slash dispatch), and each tag sits on its own
 *   trailing line, carrying the origin workspace path when there is one so
 *   grok can act on the real file, not just the pixels.
 * - Confirmed slash commands (`slashCommand: true`) flip the envelope too:
 *   `<text>\n\n<envelope>\n\n<tags>` — the same position-0 rule the tag
 *   placement already honors also applies to the envelope itself (that was
 *   the missed half: a leading envelope broke dispatch exactly like a
 *   leading tag would). Tags stay trailing in both orders, so
 *   `parseImageTags`'s strip-from-the-end assumption holds.
 * - `blocks[0]` is always the text block; image blocks follow in tag order.
 *   The restore side parses tags back out via `parseImageTags` in
 *   media/webview-helpers.js — keep the tag format in sync with it.
